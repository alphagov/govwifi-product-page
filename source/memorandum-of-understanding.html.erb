        <p class="govuk-body">9. Security of GovWifi Data</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"> 9.1. In addition to the requirements in Clause 8 in respect of Personal Data, both the Organisation and the Cabinet Office agree to handle all the GovWifi Data in accordance with the following security requirements:</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"> 9.1.a. Access to the GovWifi Data (including any part of the GovWifi Data and any copies), will be restricted to service teams that require the data for debugging or integration purposes, operations staff supporting GovWifi implementation and/or building/premises wireless infrastructure support and the cloud-based Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider selected by the Cabinet Office.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"> 9.1.b. GovWifi Data will be stored in an encrypted format when it is in transit between Organisational systems and the GovWifi Authentication Service, when it is in transit between the GovWifi Authentication Service and its 3rd party suppliers, and when it is stored in the GovWifi Authentication Service (within the retention periods defined). The number of named individuals that have access to the systems in which the data passes and is stored will be kept to a minimum.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"> 9.1.c. GovWifi Data will not be stored or otherwise transferred outside the UK European Economic Area unless in full compliance with obligations of Data Protection Legislation/UKGDPR requirements.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">10. Freedom of Information</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">10.1 Both The Cabinet Office and the Organisation are subject to the provisions of FOIA and the Environmental Information Regulations and shall assist and cooperate with each other to enable each other to comply with their respective statutory duties in relation to Requests for Information. In particular, where either the Cabinet Office or the Organisation receive a Request for Information pertaining to the subject matter or operation of this Agreement, it shall as soon as practicable notify the other&#39;s nominated representative, in writing, of the details of the information requested, the date such request was made and, if permitted by law, the name of the person making the request. The party which has received the request shall, prior to responding to the applicant, consult with the other party and to facilitate such consultation shall provide it with a copy of all information which it proposes to disclose not less than 5 working days before disclosure.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11. Loss and Unauthorised Release</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.1. The Organisation will report any loss or unauthorised release of the GovWifi Data to the GovWifi team as soon as possible, and in any event within 24 hours of becoming aware of the Data Breach.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.2. The Organisation acknowledges that any loss or unauthorised release of the GovWifi Data will be valid grounds for immediate termination of this Agreement, the consequences of which will be an immediate revocation of the Organisation&#39;s premises&#39; wireless system integration with the GovWifi Authentication Service.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.3. Any loss or unauthorised release of the GovWifi Data by the Organisation will need to be investigated jointly by both The Cabinet Office and the Organisation. Existing Cabinet Office data incident processes and reporting will be utilised.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.4. If financial penalties are imposed by the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office on either the Cabinet Office or the Organisation for a Data Breach then the following will occur:</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.4.a. If The Cabinet Office is responsible for the relevant breach, in that it is caused as a result of the actions or inaction of systems and procedures controlled by GovWifi, then the Cabinet Office will be responsible for the payment of these financial penalties. In this case, if the Cabinet Office conducts an internal audit or engages an independent forensic investigator to conduct a thorough audit of any such data incident, the Organisation will provide to the Cabinet Office and its forensic investigators and auditors, on request, full cooperation and access to conduct a thorough audit of such data incident.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.4.b. If the Organisation is responsible for the relevant breach, in that it is not a breach that the Cabinet Office is responsible for, then the Organisation will be responsible for the payment of these financial penalties. The Cabinet Office will provide to the Organisation and its forensic investigators and auditors, on request, full cooperation and access to conduct a thorough audit of such data incidents.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.4.c. If responsibility is unclear, then the Cabinet Office and the Organisation will work together to investigate the relevant data incident and allocate responsibility for any financial penalties as outlined above, or by agreement to split any financial penalties equally if no responsibility for the Data Breach can be apportioned. In the event that the parties do not agree such apportionment then such Dispute shall be referred to the escalation route as set out in para 3.8.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.4.d. If either the Organisation or the Cabinet Office is the defendant in a legal claim brought by a third party related to a Data Breach, then unless the parties otherwise agree, the party that is determined by the final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction (&quot;Court&quot;) or the ICO to be responsible for the breach shall be liable for the Total Claim Losses arising from such breach. Where both parties are liable the liability will be apportioned between the parties in accordance with the decision of the Court or the ICO as the case may be.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.5. In respect of any losses, cost claims or expenses incurred by either party as a result of a Data Breach:</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.5.a. If The Cabinet Office is responsible for the relevant breach, then the Cabinet Office will be responsible for the payment of the Total Claim Losses.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.5.b. If the Organisation is responsible for the relevant breach, then the Organisation will be responsible for the payment of the Total Claim Losses. If responsibility is unclear, the Cabinet Office and the Organisation will split the total claim losses equally.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">11.5.c. Any Data Breach will be grounds for immediate termination of this MoU.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">12. Use of GovWifi in overseas locations</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">12.1. GovWifi is only for use by visiting UK government officials, internal staff, and specifically invited guests in locations such as UK embassies, British High Commissions, consulates or similar. Other visitors (local nation visitors) will be kept separate from GovWifi and use, for example, existing guest wifi networks.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">12.2. Should the Organisation wish to use GovWifi in a way that contravenes 12.1, it will contact the GovWifi team for advice.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">13. Termination</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">13.1. Subject to paragraphs 13.2 and 13.3 below, either the Cabinet Office or the Organisation may terminate this Agreement upon three months&#39; written notice to the other.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">13.2. In the case where the Agreement is being terminated due to decommissioning of the GovWifi Authentication Service itself, the Cabinet Office will issue three months&#39; written notice of termination to the Organisation.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">13.3. Either the Cabinet Office or the Organisation may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect in the event of either a breach of its obligations by the other to this Agreement, or of the guidance on the requirements and recommendations laid out on the GovWifi service website.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">14. Changes to this Agreement</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">14.1. Except where explicitly noted above, this Agreement may only be varied in writing as described below. The Cabinet Office will establish and manage a configuration version control system for this Agreement</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">14.2. The Cabinet Office may amend this Agreement from time to time after giving 30 days notice to the Organisation. The notice must be in writing, and must set out the change required in sufficient detail to enable both parties to understand the implications of the change; the implications of implementing the change; impact on current service provision; and the method of implementation. The change will automatically take effect at the end of the notice period unless the Organisation terminates this Agreement in accordance with Clause 13.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">14.3. The Organisation may request changes to this Agreement. The request must be in writing, and must set out the change required in sufficient detail to enable both parties to understand the implications of the change and be able to respond within one month unless agreed otherwise. The response will set out the implications of implementing the change, impact on current service provision, required amendments to this Agreement and proposed method of implementation. The parties may then agree to the change, continue without making the change, or terminate this Agreement in accordance with Clause 13.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">15.1. This Agreement sets out a formal agreement between two Crown bodies, and an informal agreement between the Cabinet Office and non-Crown bodies. Both the Cabinet Office and the Organisation &#39;agree that it will have no legal effect between them.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">15.2. Any dispute concerning this Agreement will be resolved by negotiation between appropriately senior officers in the Organisation and the Cabinet Office, as set out in the escalation procedure described in paragraph 3.8 above.</p>
